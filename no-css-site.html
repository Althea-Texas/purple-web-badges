			<p>Specialization badges allow you to develop your own path through the course material. There are five badge categories: coding,  graphic design, user experience design, power user skills, and entrepreneurship.</p>

<p>The specialization badge grade accounts for 35% of your overall grade. In order to earn an A badge grade, students must master at least five specialization badges, with at least one from each category. In order to earn a B badge grade, students must master at least four specialization badges, with one from each category. In order to earn a C badge grade students must complete at least three specialization badges, and one of these must be a programming badge.</p>
