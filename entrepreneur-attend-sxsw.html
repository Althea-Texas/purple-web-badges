<h2>Entrepreneurship</h2>
<h1>Attend SxSW Interactive</h1>
<div id="intro">

<p>Every March, geeks from around the world congregate in Austin for South by Southwest (SXSW) Interactive. Attending this conference is a great way of keeping up with the latest industry trends, and it's also a terrific place for networking. Badges are not cheap. It is $850 for the interactive badge if you pay full price. There may be discounted options available for students, and you might be able to volunteer your time in exchange for admission. If you are affiliated with the Trinitonian or any other publications, you might be eligible for a press pass. All of the conference hotels are sold out for all dates, so you will need to crash with a friend or commute between cities. Despite the hassle, attending SXSW is still a worthwhile experience.</p>

<p>To earn the badge, you need to attend at least three panels. You should take notes at the panels, you should take photos with your phone or camera, and, if possible, you should capture some video clips from the event. When the conference is finished, you will complete the badge by synthesizing all of this material in a 1,000 to 1,500 word blog posting.</p>
<p>If you pursue this badge, please, I strongly encourage you not to refer to the conference as "South by." It's a bizarre hipster practice, and it just sounds ridiculous. As Mike Taylor wrote in New York Observer, "now they call it 'South By' and soon it will just be a vague hiss: like 'suuuuuh.'" David Hansen agrees, writing "Frankly, I find it irritating. I'm not being anal. It's totally lazy. It's already an acronym. They already abbreviated it for you, and I know you have the time for those extra two syllables... Please stop."</p>

<h3>BADGE DELIVERABLES</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Point your web browser at the official SXSW site to find out <em>when</em> it will happen. The event typically happens in March, and it occasionally overlaps Spring Break. Registration is in January, so you will need to act quickly if you choose to pursue this badge.</li>
	<li>If you work for a local media outlet (e.g. <em>Trinitonian</em>, <em>Rivard Report</em>, <em>San Antonio Current</em>, or <em>Tiger TV</em>, you might be able to apply for a press credential. Search the SXSW site for information about "press credentials." </li>
	<li>If regular badges are too expensive -- and you cannot qualify for a press credential -- you might be able to apply for a student badge. Search the SXSW site for information about student pricing.</li>
	<li>Investigate volunteer opportunities. If all of the above options are out of the question, you can also volunteer in exchange for access to the conference. In order to do this, you will need to fill out a first-time volunteer registration form and attend an orientation session in January or February.</li>
	<li>In order to earn this badge, you will need to attend a full day of events at SXSW Interactive (at least three separate sessions). You should document the experience by taking photos of the conference panels, the exhibition hall, and other SXSW events. You should also take notes on the sessions that you attend.</li>
	<li>After the conference is over, you should post a detailed blog posting (1,000 - 1,250 words) describing the experience. What events did you attend, and what sorts of ideas and technologies were discussed? What was the most exciting thing you saw at the conference? What was your overall impression? Be sure to include photos and direct quotes in your conference write-up. When you reference particular companies and individuals, be sure to include links to the relevant web presence for these companies and individuals.</li>
