<h2>EMPOWERED USER</h2>
<h1>GARAGEBAND BASICS</h1>
<div id="intro">
<p>In a recent review, Wired Magazine noted that GarageBand "features an intuitive interface that's accessible to music newbies yet nuanced enough for experienced musicians to use as a scratch pad. And because it lets you play various instruments and record each independently to create songs, you can literally form a one-man band."</p>

<p>In order to complete this badge, you will need access to a Macintosh computer equipped with the Garage Band software. If you recently purchased a Macintosh, it is possible that this software is already installed on your system. You can also access the Garage Band software on computers in the library.</p>

<h3>BADGE DELIVERABLES</h3>
<ol>
    
<li>Log on to Lynda.Com, and locate Garrick Chow's tutorial "<a href="https://www.lynda.com/GarageBand-tutorials/GarageBand-Essential-Training/156620-2.html" name="" target="_self">GarageBand Essential Training</a>." This tutorial's official duration is 4 hours and 43 minutes, so you should expect to devote approximately six hours to the tutorial. </li>

<li>Work through the first six lessons of this tutorial. This includes the following: "Getting started," "Working with loops and drummer," "Working with software instruments," "Working with real instruments," "Arranging, editing, and mixing your project," and "Exporting, sharing, and archiving your project." </li>

<li>Don't just watch and try to memorize the steps. Instead, you should follow along with the instructor, with your hands on the mouse and keyboard. In order to do this, you will need to download the "exercise files" that are linked to the lesson. If you are unable to locate the files, please contact me, and I'll point you in the right direction.  </li>

<li>After spending approximately six hours with this video tutorial, create and record an original song using the software's virtual instruments and sound loops.</li>

<li>When you have finished creating your song, upload the file to a subfolder of your account on the class web server.</li>

<li>All badge write-ups should be posted to your personal blog. In a short (3-5 paragraph) blog posting with a captioned screenshot, include a link to your song and explain how you created it. Now that you have spent some time with this tool, what do you think about the GarageBand software? What would you like to learn how to do next with this application?</li>

<li>Remember to complete the badge assignment by e-mailing Dr. Delwiche with the subject line "Pending: Empowered User Garageband" and be sure to link to your blog posting in that message.</li>
